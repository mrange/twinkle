Bugs
----
01. Attached event only raised when logical tree is attached to a document element?
02. Make sure SharpDX isn't implicitly exported in the interface
02.1. Reduce the usage of Vector2 in the public API

Features
--------
12. Adding support for Direct2D effects
09. Work on the randomization algorithm so that the border squares are less obvious
04. Add support for geometry realizations (when sharpdx supports it)
05. Add support for caching of subtrees
06. Use units to avoid mixing up floats representing different concepts


Fixed Bugs
----------
07. Shared resources should be freed on dispose

Added Features
--------------
11. Adding support for gradient brushes
10. Support user specified geometries
03. Figure out a way to faster lookups from descriptors ==> sharpdx primitives
