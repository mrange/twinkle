Working on
----------
3. Figure out a way to faster lookups from descriptors ==> sharpdx primitives

Bugs
----
1. Attached event only raised when logical tree is attached to a document element?
2. Make sure SharpDX isn't implicitly exported in the interface

Features
--------
4. Add support for geometry realizations (when sharpdx supports it)
5. Add support for caching of subtrees
6. Use units to avoid mixing up floats representing different concepts


Fixed Bugs
----------
7. Shared resources should be freed on dispose

Added Features
