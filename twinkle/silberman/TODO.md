Bugs
----
01. Attached event only raised when logical tree is attached to a document element?
02. Make sure SharpDX isn't implicitly exported in the interface

Features
--------
10. Support user specified geometries
09. Work on the randomization algorithm so that the border squares are less obvious
04. Add support for geometry realizations (when sharpdx supports it)
05. Add support for caching of subtrees
06. Use units to avoid mixing up floats representing different concepts


Fixed Bugs
----------
07. Shared resources should be freed on dispose

Added Features
--------------
03. Figure out a way to faster lookups from descriptors ==> sharpdx primitives
